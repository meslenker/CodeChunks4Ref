/*Originally I used a process that would check if a trigger was set and fail the refresh by using the SQL statement "Select 1 from notable" if the trigger wasn't set.
The refresh would run every 10 mins, which meant this refresh had a failure wait of about 90%. In order to get more accurate statistics for the job, I opted to 
move to a Do loop option. The job that creates the trigger runs 5 times a day, so I scheduled my QlikSense refresh loop to start around the average end time of 
each of those job runs.*/
